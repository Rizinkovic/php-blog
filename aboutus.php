        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Rizinkovic</strong> — my personal space on the web where I share my passion for web development, coding experiments, and digital building blocks that shape the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into web development started not in a classroom, but with curiosity and frustration. I was tired of not understanding how websites worked — how buttons knew what to do, how data flowed from one screen to another. That single question turned into late-night YouTube binges, endless lines of trial-and-error code, and a steady love for HTML, CSS, and eventually JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, I learned to build from scratch. From small landing pages to full dynamic blogs, I taught myself how to make websites that not only worked — but felt personal. My early tools were just a browser and a basic text editor. Today, I use VS Code, GitHub, frameworks like Bootstrap, and custom PHP backends to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p>
            My blog, Rizinkovic, is not just a portfolio — it's a reflection of how I grew from someone Googling "how to center a div" to someone building multi-page platforms with login systems, forums, income trackers, and more. I code with purpose now — whether it's a resume builder for students or a personal budgeting app for hustlers like me, every line serves a real-world need.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mostly build in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and I’m exploring SQL databases, responsive design, form validation, and secure login systems. I’m also learning how to deploy full websites using GitHub Pages and hosting panels like InfinityFree.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in clean code, simple UX, and creating tools that matter. I’ve been through the pain of debugging alone, learning from broken layouts, and realizing that Google is the best dev friend you'll ever have. Now, I want to help others go through the learning process a little easier — that’s part of why this blog exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you’re a fellow beginner or a seasoned dev passing through, thanks for checking out Rizinkovic. This blog is my lab, my library, and my legacy — and I’m just getting started.
